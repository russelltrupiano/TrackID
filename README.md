# TrackID
A simple webapp for studying recognition of songs from short clips throughout

## Getting Set up
1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.35/node-v0.10.35.pkg)
2. ```git clone https://github.com/russelltrupiano/TrackID.git```
3. ``` cd TrackID```
4. ``` npm install ```
5. ``` npm start ```
6. ``` open http://localhost:3000 ```

## Using custom songs
You're more than welcome to replace the songs you're looking to study with your own. By default these files are stored in public/tracks/ and need to have the format [TRACK NAME] - [COMPOSER].[EXTENSION]. The page will automatically generate a randomized sorting of the tracks and a sample of 20 seconds can be played for each song. Answers can be typed in and checked or shown via the 'Show Me' button below the track
