### [You can view a live demo of this project here](bit.ly/pat201listening)

## Getting Set up
1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.35/node-v0.10.35.pkg)
2. Install [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Launcing the project
Then run the following commands in your terminal

1. ```git clone https://github.com/russelltrupiano/TrackID.git```
2. ``` cd TrackID```
3. ``` npm install ```
4. ``` npm start ```
5. ``` open http://localhost:3000 ```

## Using custom songs
You're more than welcome to replace the songs you're looking to study with your own. By default these files are stored in public/tracks/ and need to have the format [COMPOSER] - [TRACK NAME].[EXTENSION] \(For example The Beatles - Revolution 9.mp3\). The page will automatically generate a randomized sorting of the tracks and a sample of 20 seconds can be played for each song. Answers can be typed in and checked or shown via the 'Show Me' button below the track
